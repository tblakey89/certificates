FIRST COMMIT THOUGHTS
- My interpretation of the mock ups implies that we need to display an
  existing credential on the page, probably in its own component, we will
  then add the Magento cerfificates underneath in a ng-repeat.
- We will use ng-messages for the credential form for the errors when
  inputting the URL
- We will make the form flexible, it doesn't have to be only Magento, all we
  need to do is send a different regexp and name for it to be flexible
- The angular code can be written with only two functions, one in the form
  component to check the validity of the URL before calling the second
  function, which will be in the certificate controller, passed to the form
- Ideally we would minify the javascript and keep the dependencies in the
  package.json, but I am not too familiar with node.js.
- We could use the http service, or ng-resource for the get_url call
- The get_url call can be used for any certification website, not just
  Magento, we could use a switch statement, or some regexp, or something,
  to determine if it should check through the Magento html. Default is
  an error
- We could show server side error within loader, asking the user to try
  again, or re-enter URL

VIDEO IDEAS
- Discuss that I should have minified the JavaScript files
- Talk about the vm instead of $scope stuff
- Talk about the styleguide
- Discuss the advantages of components (over directives, and code in
  controllers), component based architecture?
- Explain structure, my reason for the controllers, etc
  
BEFORE SUBMIT CHECKS
- Specs are passing
- Don't forget to check capitalisations, colours, etc
- Add a reference to styleguide, as references are on the rubric thing
